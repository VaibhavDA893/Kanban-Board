[Kanban Preview](https://github.com/VaibhavDA893/assests/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-05-04%20095543.png)

📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a fully responsive Kanban Board application built using React.js, designed to help teams and individuals manage tasks visually across different stages of progress like To Do, In Progress, and Done.

Inspired by productivity tools like Trello and Jira, this app allows users to drag and drop tasks, add new cards, manage task statuses, and stay organized using a simple yet powerful task tracking interface.


  Features

- 🧩 Modular Column Layout: Tasks organized into draggable columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- ✍️ Add New Tasks: Users can quickly add cards with task names and descriptions
- 🔁 Drag and Drop Functionality: Move tasks between stages using React DnD or similar libraries
- ✏️ Edit / Delete Tasks (Optional): Ability to modify or remove existing cards
- 🌙 Responsive UI: Works across devices using flexible layout components
- 📁 Component-Based Architecture: Clean and scalable code using functional components and hooks
